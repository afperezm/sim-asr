# Automatic Speech Recognition of Colombian Dialects

This repository contains code and scripts to train Mozilla's DeepSpeech ASR models using two different datasets of
Latin American Spanish:

- The first one is a 20 hours dataset of CrowdSourced Latin American Spanish that contains six different dialectal
variations, namely Argentinean, Chilean, Colombian, Peruvian, Puerto Rican and Venezuelan.
- The second one is a 920 hours dataset of Colombian Spanish with multiple dialectal variations ranging from Caribbean
to Andean dialects. It is the result of a set of interviews carried out by the Colombia's "Commission for the
Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-repetition" between 2018 and 2020 to victims of the Colombian armed
conflict.
